## Build Spek for macOS

[[简体中文 Simplified Chinese]](./README-zh_CN.md)

Build steps:
* Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
* Enter the project directory.
* Install the dependencies: `./dist/osx/install_deps.sh`. This procedure will take some time. Your sudo password may be required.
* Compile and bundle Spek: `./dist/osx/bundle.sh`.

You can modify `install_deps.sh` and `bundle.sh` as needed.
